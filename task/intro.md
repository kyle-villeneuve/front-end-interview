# Overview

You'll be building a reusable data grid component in React with TypeScript. The goal is to create a generic, type-safe table that can display any dataset with sorting and selection capabilities.

**What We're Looking For:**

- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper TypeScript usage (generics, type safety)
- Good component architecture and separation of concerns
- Thoughtful API design for the component interface
- Bonus points for custom hooks if the logic can be cleanly abstracted

**Tips**

- Think out loud - explain your decisions as you code
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- Focus on core functionality first, then iterate
- Don't worry about perfect styling - functionality is more important
- Consider edge cases (empty data, missing properties, etc.)
